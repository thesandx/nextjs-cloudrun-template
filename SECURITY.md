# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue.**

Use GitHub's private reporting: **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**. If that is unavailable, contact the repository owner directly.

Please include what you found, how to reproduce it, and what an attacker could do with it. You will get an acknowledgement within a few days and an assessment shortly after.

## Supported versions

This is a template. Security fixes land on `main`; there are no maintained release branches. Projects generated from it own their own dependency updates — Dependabot is preconfigured to help.

## Security model

### No long-lived credentials

The deployment pipeline authenticates through Workload Identity Federation. **No JSON service account key is created, stored or committed.** A key is a permanent bearer credential; an OIDC token lives for minutes and is bound to this repository by an attribute condition.

If you see `credentials_json:` or a `*.json` key anywhere in a project built from this template, that is a finding — report it.

See [ADR-0002](./docs/adr/0002-use-workload-identity-federation.md) and [`cloud/github-actions.md`](./cloud/github-actions.md).

### Identity separation

Two service accounts, deliberately distinct:

- **Deployer** — impersonated by CI. Can push images and deploy revisions. Cannot read application data.
- **Runtime** — the identity the application runs as. Can read its own secrets. Cannot deploy or modify IAM.

Compromise of either is contained.

### Container hardening

| Control                                                                         | Where                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Non-root user (uid 1001)                                                        | `Dockerfile`                                  |
| Minimal surface — no source, no dev deps, no package manager in the final image | `Dockerfile` (standalone output)              |
| Pinned base image versions                                                      | `Dockerfile` build args                       |
| Read-only root filesystem, `no-new-privileges`                                  | `docker-compose.yml`, `scripts/docker-run.sh` |
| Correct signal handling (`dumb-init`)                                           | `Dockerfile`                                  |

### Pipeline hardening

| Control                                                   | Where                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Least-privilege `permissions:` per workflow and job       | `.github/workflows/*`      |
| `persist-credentials: false` on checkout                  | all workflows              |
| PR validation requires no cloud credentials               | `pr-validation.yml`        |
| Provider pinned to this repository by attribute condition | Workload Identity provider |
| CodeQL on PRs and weekly                                  | `codeql.yml`               |
| Dependabot on npm, Actions and Docker                     | `dependabot.yml`           |

### Application

- Security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`) set in `next.config.ts`; `X-Powered-By` removed.
- Environment configuration validated at startup — a missing required variable fails the revision instead of serving broken responses.
- Secrets come from Secret Manager at runtime, never from build args (visible in `docker history`) and never from `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` (shipped to every browser).

## Hardening checklist for a real deployment

The template is a safe default, not a finished security posture. Before production:

- [ ] Narrow the deployer's `roles/run.admin` to `run.developer` or a custom role
- [ ] Restrict the Workload Identity attribute condition to `refs/heads/main`
- [ ] Add required reviewers to the `production` GitHub Environment
- [ ] Enable branch protection on `main`: required checks, required review, no force push
- [ ] Enable Artifact Registry vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Set a billing budget with alerts — cost is a security control against runaway abuse
- [ ] Decide whether `--allow-unauthenticated` is correct; remove it for internal services
- [ ] Add rate limiting if any endpoint is expensive or writes data
- [ ] Grant the runtime service account only the roles the application actually uses
- [ ] Add a Content-Security-Policy once you know which origins the app legitimately loads from

## What is out of scope

Findings in dependencies belong upstream — though we want to know if this repository pins a version with a known advisory. Vulnerabilities in Google Cloud itself go to [Google's VRP](https://bughunters.google.com/).
