# Local development

## Prerequisites

| Tool       | Version         | Notes                                                    |
| ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js    | 22 LTS or newer | Pinned in `.nvmrc`; `nvm use` picks it up                |
| pnpm       | 10 or newer     | `corepack enable` installs the version in `package.json` |
| Docker     | any recent      | Only needed for container work                           |
| gcloud CLI | any recent      | Only needed for deployment work                          |

```bash
# Node via nvm
nvm install && nvm use

# pnpm via corepack (ships with Node — do not npm install -g pnpm)
corepack enable
```

Corepack reads the `packageManager` field in `package.json`, so everyone gets the same pnpm version without a second thing to keep in sync.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

## Scripts

| Command              | What it does                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`           | Dev server with hot reload                                      |
| `pnpm build`         | Production build                                                |
| `pnpm start`         | Serve the production build (run `build` first)                  |
| `pnpm typecheck`     | `tsc --noEmit` — **run `build` at least once first**, see below |
| `pnpm lint`          | ESLint                                                          |
| `pnpm lint:fix`      | ESLint with `--fix`, including import sorting                   |
| `pnpm format`        | Prettier, writing changes                                       |
| `pnpm format:check`  | Prettier, verifying only (what CI runs)                         |
| `pnpm test`          | Vitest, once                                                    |
| `pnpm test:watch`    | Vitest in watch mode                                            |
| `pnpm test:coverage` | Vitest with a coverage report                                   |
| `pnpm validate`      | Everything CI runs, in one command                              |
| `pnpm docker:build`  | Build the production image locally                              |
| `pnpm docker:run`    | Run it and wait for health                                      |
| `pnpm clean`         | Remove `.next`, `coverage`, `node_modules`                      |

> **`pnpm typecheck` on a fresh clone fails until you have built once.** `next build` generates `next-env.d.ts` and `.next/types/**`, which `tsc` needs to resolve JSX and typed routes. Both are gitignored. `pnpm dev` also generates them. CI runs `build` before `typecheck` for the same reason.

## Editor setup

VS Code picks up the recommended extensions and settings from `.vscode/`. The two that matter:

- **ESLint** — inline lint errors, fix on save
- **Prettier** — format on save

For other editors: enable format-on-save with Prettier, and point your LSP at the workspace TypeScript version (`node_modules/typescript`), not a globally installed one. A version mismatch produces errors that nobody else sees.

## The development loop

```
edit → hot reload → pnpm validate → commit → PR
```

Run `pnpm validate` before pushing. It is exactly what CI runs, so a green local run means a green PR — and catches the format-check failure that otherwise costs a round trip.

## Working with the container

The dev server is not what production runs. Before touching anything in `Dockerfile`, `next.config.ts`, or the environment model, verify against the real image:

```bash
docker compose up --build
curl localhost:8080/api/health
docker compose ps          # should say "healthy", not just "running"
docker compose down
```

Or without Compose:

```bash
pnpm docker:build
pnpm docker:run
```

Things that only show up here: wrong `PORT` handling, binding to localhost, missing static assets, permission errors from the non-root user, and slow cold starts.

## Environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local   # gitignored
```

Next.js loads `.env.local` automatically. Precedence, highest first: shell environment → `.env.local` → `.env.$NODE_ENV` → `.env`.

Adding a variable? All four steps, same PR — see [`cloud/environment-variables.md`](../cloud/environment-variables.md#adding-a-variable).

## Adding a dependency

Read [rule 8](../.github/instructions/coding-rules.md#8-avoid-unnecessary-dependencies) first. If it is still justified:

```bash
pnpm add <package>              # runtime
pnpm add -D <package>           # build/test only
```

If the package needs a lifecycle script to install, pnpm will block it and tell you. Add it to `allowBuilds` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` deliberately, and say why in the PR — that block is a supply-chain control, not a nuisance.

Commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`. CI installs with `--frozen-lockfile` and will fail without it.
