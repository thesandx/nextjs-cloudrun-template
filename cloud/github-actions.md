# GitHub Actions and Workload Identity Federation

How CI authenticates to Google Cloud without a single stored credential, and what to do when it breaks.

---

## Why not service account keys

The obvious approach is `gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json`, paste it into a GitHub secret, done. It works, and it is the wrong answer.

| Service account key                                        | Workload Identity Federation                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Never expires — valid until someone remembers to revoke it | Token lives ~1 hour, scoped to one workflow run      |
| Works from anywhere on the internet                        | Only a token from _this repository_ can be exchanged |
| Sits in GitHub, in someone's downloads, in a Slack thread  | No key material exists to leak                       |
| Rotation is a manual chore nobody does                     | Rotation is automatic and invisible                  |
| A leak is silent                                           | Every exchange is in Cloud Audit Logs                |

Google's own guidance is to avoid downloading keys, and many organisations disable key creation by org policy (`constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`). **This repository must never contain one.**

## The workflow side

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write # ← without this, step 1 silently produces no token

jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - uses: google-github-actions/auth@v3
        with:
          project_id: ${{ vars.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}
          workload_identity_provider: ${{ secrets.WIF_PROVIDER }}
          service_account: ${{ secrets.WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}
          token_format: access_token
```

`WIF_PROVIDER` is the full resource name:

```
projects/123456789/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/providers/github
```

Note it uses the **project number**, not the project id. Using the id is the most common setup mistake.

---

## IAM model

Two service accounts, deliberately separate:

```
github-deployer@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com    ← CI impersonates this
├── roles/artifactregistry.writer   (on the repository)  push images
├── roles/run.admin                 (on the project)     deploy services
└── roles/iam.serviceAccountUser    (on the runtime SA)  assign it to a revision

<service>-runtime@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com   ← the app runs as this
└── (nothing by default; grant only what the app needs)
```

**Why separate:** the pipeline can deploy but has no access to application data. The application can read its own secrets but cannot deploy itself or modify IAM. A compromise of either is contained.

`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` on the runtime account is the one people forget. Without it the deploy fails with a permission error naming an account you did not expect.

### Tightening further

`roles/run.admin` is broad — it can delete services and modify IAM. For a hardened setup, use `roles/run.developer` plus explicit bindings, or a custom role limited to:

```
run.services.get
run.services.create
run.services.update
run.revisions.get
run.revisions.list
run.operations.get
```

Start with `run.admin`, verify the pipeline works, then narrow. Narrowing first turns a five-minute setup into an afternoon of permission archaeology.

## Restricting which refs can deploy

The default attribute condition allows any workflow in the repository — including one on a feature branch — to obtain deploy credentials. To require `main`:

```bash
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers update-oidc github \
  --location=global \
  --workload-identity-pool=github \
  --attribute-condition="assertion.repository == 'thesandx/my-app' && assertion.ref == 'refs/heads/main'"
```

Or bind the principal more narrowly instead of widening the condition:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding "$DEPLOYER" \
  --role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
  --member="principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/${PROJECT_NUMBER}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github/attribute.ref/refs/heads/main"
```

Combine with a GitHub Environment restricted to `main` and required reviewers for defence in depth: GitHub gates who can trigger, Google gates what the token can do.

---

## Verifying the setup

```bash
# The provider exists and its condition is right
gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers describe github \
  --location=global --workload-identity-pool=github \
  --format="yaml(name, attributeCondition, attributeMapping, oidc.issuerUri)"

# The principal can impersonate the deployer
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy \
  "github-deployer@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# What the deployer can do
gcloud projects get-iam-policy "$PROJECT_ID" \
  --flatten="bindings[].members" \
  --filter="bindings.members:github-deployer@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --format="value(bindings.role)"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### `Unable to acquire impersonated credentials`

The exchange failed. Almost always one of:

1. **`id-token: write` missing** from the job's `permissions`. The most common cause by far.
2. **Wrong `WIF_PROVIDER`** — check it uses the project _number_ and the full `projects/.../providers/...` path.
3. **`attribute-condition` does not match.** Compare the exact `owner/repo` string, including case.
4. **Missing `roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser`** binding on the deployer SA for the `principalSet://` member.

Inspect what GitHub actually asserted by adding a temporary debug step:

```yaml
- run: |
    curl -sH "Authorization: bearer $ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN" \
      "$ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL&audience=https://iam.googleapis.com/${{ secrets.WIF_PROVIDER }}" \
      | jq -r '.value' | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d 2>/dev/null | jq
```

This prints the JWT claims (no signature, so it is safe) — compare `repository` and `ref` against your condition. **Remove the step afterwards.**

### `Permission 'iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken' denied`

The `principalSet://` member is missing or malformed on the deployer service account. Re-run step 6 of the manual setup in [deployment.md](./deployment.md).

### `Permission 'run.services.get' denied`

The deployer SA lacks `roles/run.admin` on the project.

### `Permission 'iam.serviceaccounts.actAs' denied`

The deployer cannot assign the runtime service account to the revision. Grant `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` on the _runtime_ SA to the _deployer_ SA.

### `denied: Permission "artifactregistry.repositories.uploadArtifacts" denied`

Missing `roles/artifactregistry.writer` on the repository, or `gcloud auth configure-docker` was not run for that registry host.

### Auth works for one workflow but not another

Check `permissions:` in the failing workflow. Job-level permissions override workflow-level ones — a job that redeclares `permissions:` without `id-token: write` loses it.

---

## Audit

Every impersonation is logged. To see which workflow runs obtained credentials:

```bash
gcloud logging read \
  'protoPayload.serviceName="iamcredentials.googleapis.com"
   AND protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalSubject:"workloadIdentityPools"' \
  --limit=20 \
  --format='table(timestamp, protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalSubject)'
```

The `principalSubject` contains the repository and ref, so an unexpected entry is immediately visible.

## Checklist

- [ ] No `credentials_json` or key file anywhere in the repository
- [ ] `permissions: id-token: write` on every job that authenticates
- [ ] `attribute-condition` pins the provider to this repository
- [ ] Deployer and runtime service accounts are separate identities
- [ ] `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` granted on the runtime SA to the deployer
- [ ] Production deploys gated by a GitHub Environment
- [ ] Roles narrowed after the pipeline is proven to work
