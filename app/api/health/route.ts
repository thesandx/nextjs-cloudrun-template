/**
 * Liveness / readiness probe.
 *
 * Consumed by three things, which is why it must stay fast and dependency-free:
 *   - the Docker `HEALTHCHECK` instruction (local and Compose runs)
 *   - Cloud Run startup and liveness probes
 *   - uptime checks / load balancer health checks
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT reach out to databases or third-party APIs. A probe
 * that fails when a downstream dependency blips will make Cloud Run kill a
 * perfectly healthy container and amplify the outage. Add a separate
 * `/api/health/deep` endpoint for dependency checks if you need one, and point
 * only dashboards — never the orchestrator — at it.
